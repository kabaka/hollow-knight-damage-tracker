> **Never lose track of a nail strike again‚Äîlog every blow from the Crossroads to the Radiance.**

Hollow Knight Damage Tracker is a responsive companion app that captures your Knight's build, every swing, spell, and summon, and translates them into real-time boss progress. Whether you're practicing Godhome pantheons, routing a speedrun, or finally toppling the Pure Vessel, the tracker keeps you focused on the fight.

> ‚ú® Designed for co-pilots, commentators, and VOD reviewers‚Äîlet a trusted spectator log hits live or replay the action later while you stay locked in on the battle.

## Features

### For the Hardcore Player üõ°Ô∏è

- **Pantheon pacing:** Queue Godhome pantheons or the Black Egg Temple rush and the tracker will advance to the next foe as soon as their mask counter hits zero.
- **Conditional encounters:** Toggle optional bosses like Grey Prince Zote, Sisters of Battle, or The Radiance so every sequence mirrors your save file.
- **Keyboard-first logging:** Memorize the number-row + QWERTY shortcuts (or tap <kbd>Esc</kbd> / <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>) and keep your fingers free for your controller.

### For the Strategist üß†

- **Your Knight's build:** Combine nail upgrades, spell levels, and charms‚Äîincluding retaliatory vines, minions, and spell conversions‚Äîto instantly see tuned damage presets.
- **Boss presets & custom targets:** Swap between Hallownest's fiercest foes, Godhome variants (Attuned, Ascended, Radiant), or set a custom HP pool for practice sessions.
- **Attack grid mastery:** Log nail strikes, spells, and charm effects with undo/redo support. Each button shows how many more hits of that move would finish the fight.

### For the Analyst üìä

- **Live combat analytics:** Track remaining HP, DPS, average damage, and actions per minute with silky 60 FPS updates and sparkline charts.
- **Session persistence:** Your build choices, attack history, and pantheon progress survive browser refreshes and accidental restarts.
- **CI-backed reliability:** Automated linting, unit tests, e2e tests, and deployments run on every push so the tracker is always ready for battle.

## Project Goals

- Support desktop and mobile layouts for quick access during gameplay.
- Allow users to configure their active charms, nail upgrades, spell upgrades, and other modifiers that influence damage values.
- Provide quick buttons for every relevant attack type (nail swings, abilities, spells, and charm interactions) so damage can be recorded with a single tap.
- Offer boss presets or custom targets where each logged hit reduces the remaining health until it reaches zero.
- Display live combat statistics such as DPS, average damage per action, and actions per second.
- Automate deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
- Enforce high code quality with linting, unit tests, integration tests, and pre-commit checks.

## How It Works

The UI now wires together real-time combat calculations driven by typed data models:

- `src/data/` stores structured JSON for charms, nail upgrades, spells, and boss health pools, along with helpers that expose typed lookups.
- `FightStateProvider` (under `src/features/fight-state/`) centralizes build configuration, attack logs, and derived combat statistics that power the UI.
- `BuildConfigPanel`, `AttackLogPanel`, and `CombatStatsPanel` consume the shared state to surface boss presets, configurable damage presets, and running metrics.
- Shared layout primitives live in `src/components/` and global theming resides in `src/styles/`.

Vitest (unit tests) and Playwright (e2e tests) validate that core sections render correctly and that critical interactions‚Äîsuch as selecting bosses or logging attacks‚Äîupdate derived statistics as expected.

Automated workflows in `.github/workflows/` run linting, unit tests, end-to-end tests, and GitHub Pages deployments on every push.

## Visual Language System

The global stylesheet (`src/styles/global.css`) now provides a reusable visual language for depth, translucency, and typography across the tracker.

### Layered depth tokens

- **Translucent panels:** `--surface-glass-low`, `--surface-glass-mid`, `--surface-glass-strong`, and `--surface-panel-muted` mix subtle gradients for layered glass panels.
- **Elevation shadows:** `--elevation-layer-1`, `--elevation-layer-2`, `--elevation-layer-3`, and `--elevation-inner-soft` combine drop shadows with soft inset rims to suggest stacked HUD layers.
- **Accent glows:** `--glow-accent-soft`, `--glow-accent-strong`, and the existing overcharm glow tokens keep interactive elements illuminated without hard borders.

Use these variables instead of hard-coded borders when styling new controls so components inherit the shared depth cues.

### Typography scale

- `--font-size-display`
- `--font-size-headline`
- `--font-size-title`
- `--font-size-subhead`
- `--font-size-body`
- `--font-size-caption`

Apply the scale to headings, buttons, and helper text to keep casing and rhythm consistent. Microcopy that previously relied on `text-transform: uppercase` has been converted to sentence case, so string literals should also use sentence case moving forward.

### Reusable components

- `.app-navbar` wraps sticky headers such as the encounter HUD with layered gradients and accent glow shadows.
- `.app-panel` standardizes raised content blocks used by the attack log and combat stats.
- `.summary-chip` (with modifiers like `--toolbar` and `--accent`) replaces outlined pills for timeline indicators, HP badges, and selection summaries.

When introducing new UI, prefer these primitives before adding bespoke gradients or borders.

## Tech Stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast builds and previews.
- [React](https://react.dev/) with TypeScript for a robust, type-safe UI.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for unit and end-to-end coverage.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to manage dependencies, scripts, and pre-commit hooks.

## Getting Started

The project is built with Vite + React + TypeScript and uses `pnpm` for every workflow.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18 or later
- pnpm 9 or later

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Essential scripts

| Command                             | Purpose                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm dev`                          | Launch the Vite dev server with hot module reloading.              |
| `pnpm build`                        | Type-check the project and produce an optimized production bundle. |
| `pnpm preview`                      | Serve the built app locally for final checks before deployment.    |
| `pnpm lint`                         | Run ESLint and Stylelint to enforce code style and best practices. |
| `pnpm format` / `pnpm format:check` | Apply or verify Prettier formatting across the repo.               |
| `pnpm test`                         | Execute Vitest in CI mode with coverage reporting.                 |
| `pnpm test:watch`                   | Watch unit tests while iterating on features.                      |
| `pnpm test:e2e`                     | Run Playwright end-to-end tests.                                   |

A `pre-commit` hook powered by [`simple-git-hooks`](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) automatically runs formatting, linting, and unit tests before every commit.

## Project Roadmap

- ‚úÖ **Scaffolding:** Initialize the frontend project, configure TypeScript, linting, formatting, and unit test tooling.
